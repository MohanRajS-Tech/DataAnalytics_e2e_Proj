# Step 3 - Understanding the Problem Statement 1

"What were the top 3 drivers of the Q2 revenue decline, and how did the shift in category mix (e.g., Electronics vs. Fashion) impact our overall margin?"

Reasons why finding out the revenue decline in Q2 is important
-to plan for upcoming Q2 as in retail it is best to compare similar quarters due to seasonality factor, especially if it was bad.
-to find out what went wrong and correct it, to make a good future plan they look into bad past quarters
-if they have tried any new strategy in that quater , this would help in knowing how that strategy was and whether it can be implemented again or improved.
