# Executive Summary: Strategic Growth Recommendations
**Stakeholder Report** | **Nordcart E-commerce**

## 🚀 Recommendation 1: Budget Reallocation (Profit Over Revenue)
**Finding**: Electronics drives 55% of revenue but maintains a low **1.1x POAS** (Profit on Ad Spend). In contrast, Fashion operates as a high-efficiency engine with a **4.4x POAS**, driven by superior 60% margins.
- **Action**: Reallocate **$50,000** from 'Paid Search' Electronics ads to Fashion.
- **Projected Impact**: A projected **$165,000 lift in Net Profit** by shifting spend from low-efficiency volume to high-margin growth.
- **Caveat**: Monitor Fashion POAS monthly; historical data suggests diminishing returns (saturation) as spend exceeds $120k/month.

## 🔄 Recommendation 2: Q1 Retention & Acquisition Strategy
**Finding**: The **50% revenue drop** in January is not just a seasonal fluke; it is driven by a **58% collapse in new customer signups** (dropping from 13.6k in Q4 to 5.7k in Q1). However, customers acquired via 'Organic' in Q4 show the highest 90-day repeat rate (11.3%).
- **Action**: Shift January acquisition budget toward high-loyalty Organic and Paid Search winners, and launch a "Life After Holidays" reactivation campaign targeting the high-value Fashion-heavy segment.
- **Projected Impact**: Protecting the top-line by capturing the **67% AOV lift** seen in Fashion-heavy cohorts who remain active post-holidays.

## 🎯 Recommendation 3: Email Incrementality & Channel Truth
**Finding**: Email reports a vanity ROAS of **171x**, but incrementality auditing reveals that **4.9%** of this revenue is cannibalized from Organic signups. However, a massive **86.2%** of Email revenue is driven by **True Reactivation** (users inactive for 30+ days).
- **Action**: Automate suppressions for new Organic signups during their first 7 days to minimize redundant reach, and double down on the 30-day reactivation "win-back" flows.
- **Projected Impact**: Protecting the **163x True Incremental ROAS** by focusing 100% of the budget on revenue that would not have occurred without the email touchpoint.
