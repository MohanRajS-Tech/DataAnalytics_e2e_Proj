Company Name: NordCart Commerce

Description:
NordCart Commerce is a mid-sized European e-commerce retailer operating primarily in the Netherlands and Germany. The company sells a broad catalog across Electronics, Fashion, Home, and Sports, positioning itself as a convenience-first online marketplace rather than a niche brand.

Customer acquisition is driven by a multi-channel digital strategy spanning Organic Search, Paid Search, Email, and Social. Organic traffic contributes the highest volume, while Paid Search is the largest paid growth lever with heavy, ongoing investment. Email is used mainly for retention and reactivation, resulting in higher efficiency but lower scale. Social plays an experimental role with volatile performance.

NordCart has experienced steady growth over the past two years with clear seasonality, including strong Q4 demand spikes and periodic promotional surges. Conversion rates remain relatively low, reflecting a top-of-funnel-heavy growth model and room for UX and funnel optimization.

The company is now investing in data-driven decision-making, focusing on:

Customer cohort and retention analysis

Marketing ROI and channel efficiency

Product and category profitability

Funnel conversion optimization across sessions → orders

This dataset represents NordCart at a realistic inflection point: revenue-positive, marketing-dependent, and actively optimizing for sustainable growth rather than vanity metrics.
