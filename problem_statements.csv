1,"Electronics accounts for 55% of revenue but has the lowest margins (15-18%), whereas Fashion contributes 21% with margins up to 60%. Assuming constant conversion elasticity, how would a $50k reallocation of 'Paid Search' budget from Electronics to Fashion impact total net profit, and at what point does Fashion reach demand saturation?"
2,"Revenue consistently drops by ~50% from Q4 to Q1. Which acquisition channel produces the highest 90-day repeat rate for Q4 cohorts, and would a cross-category 'January Reactivation' campaign targeting Fashion-heavy buyers provide a statistically significant lift in Q1 AOV compared to Electronics-only buyers?"
3,"Email marketing shows an exceptional ROAS (171+) but limited scale. Is Email driving true incremental revenue or cannibalizing Organic traffic? Using a time-based suppression analysis (comparing weeks with/without major blasts) and user-level session overlap, determine the true incremental lift of the Email channel."
